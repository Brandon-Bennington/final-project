# Final Project
In this project I attempted to create a game of blackjack. 

The game was not completed in time for a variety of outside factors and poor time management. 

My initial intentions for the game included more features than I truly understood how to implement and unfortunately by the time I attempted to settle for a simpler project more realistic project I barely had time to do enough to make it run. 

The original idea was for the game of blackjack to allow for the user to play against the dealer who would play according to pre-determined rules like in a casino. Assets of card images would be used for the cards and there would be an option to play with a single or double deck and choose how often the deck is shuffled. 

There are console.log(s) in the js file showing where I was testing and trying to find the issues. 
There was an effort to keep the code organized. 
The functions were written separately. 
I do intend to continue to work on this project into the future. 

Blackjack

The objective is to score more than the dealer while remaining under 21. If dealt a 21 to start the game, that individual wins. After being dealt their first two cards the player has the option to stay or hit. The player may hit as many times as they want as long as they do not pass 21. The player can also stay and hope that they dealer will pass 21 and "bust" attempting to outscore them.
